## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates the construction and manipulation of **Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)** using the [`dd`](https://github.com/tulip-control/dd) Python package. It explores how different **variable orders** affect the structure and size of the BDDs derived from fault tree expressions.

### Features
- Construction of BDDs for fault trees with custom variable ordering.
- Automatic expression negation and visualization of BDDs as `.pdf` files.
- Comparison of BDD-based analysis with other approaches using benchmark datasets.

## 🧠 Motivation

Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a widely used technique for safety assessment. The efficiency of Binary Decision Diagram (BDD)-based analysis is highly sensitive to **variable ordering**. This repository accompanies our study on optimizing this aspect for **improved performance and scalability**.
